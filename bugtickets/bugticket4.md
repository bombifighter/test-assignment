Bug Ticket - Volume adjust on Windows 10 Home does not work
===================================

**Description:** When I try to increase or decrease volume on my computer, the volume of YouTube does not change.

**Environment:** Every video on https://www.youtube.com/ on production, but only when using Windows 10 Home Edition operating system.

**Details:**
 - Expected behaviour: adding or lowering system volume adjust the volume of YouTube videos.
 - Actual behaviour: adding or lowering system volume doesn't adjust the volume of YouTube videos.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. go to https://www.youtube.com/ on Windows 10 Home edition
2. try to adjust system volume

**Severity, justification:**
Medium serenity, as the bug doesn't affect all of the users (about 10%) and affected users still can adjust volume on the site.
