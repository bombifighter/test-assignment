Bug Ticket - Notifications arriving late
===================================

**Description:** The video and live stream notifications don't arrive to the users in time.

**Environment:** Production

**Details:**
- Expected behaviour: the customer gets a notification everytime someone who they are subscribed to uploads a video or starts a live stream.
- Actual behaviour: the customer gets these notifications 2 or 3 hours later

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. subscribe to a channel
2. upload a video to that channel or start a live stream on that channel

**Severity, justification:**
Medium severity, as users cannot watch their favorite content creators' videos and live streams when they get published.
