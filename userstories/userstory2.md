User Story - Search
===================

**Story:** As a customer, I want to be able to search videos, so that I can find videos by their title, description or uploader.

**Background/Business value**: We want to be able to provide customers the opportunity to search all the videos in our database. By providing them a search service they will be able to find all the videos they want.

**Details:** We provide them a search bar, where they can type in their desired search words. These words should search in titles, descriptions or even other YouTube accounts.
We want to provide search suggestions dynamically as the customer types the letters.
On the results page we provide an opportunity to fine tune their search by adding filters.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- There is a search bar in the header of the page
- Search suggestions actively change as we type more and more words in the search bar
- On the results page there is a "Filters" button, by clicking on it, we get an additional interface where we can apply various filters such as:
   - upload date
   - type
   - length of the video
   - resolution
   - subtitles
- Next to the "Filters" section there is a dropdown where we can select the attribute to order by the videos
